Instructions to set up crontab to pull user data.

Dependencies:
- A computer system that runs the Cron Daemon or something that performs the same function
- pullFollowersData.sh
- retrieveFriends.jar

Set up

1. open pullFollowersData.sh and update the file path to your jar executable.
2. Create empty adjacencyList.json and queue.txt files. Create count.txt and type in one line - "0".
3. In terminal, type in the command " crontab -e" and type the following lines.
# pulls Twitter user data every min
# * * * * * ~/Path/to/your/script/pullFollowersData.sh > /dev/null 2>&1

take away the "#" in front of the second line to run the cron job. you can disable it by adding the
"#" back in

4. Save and exit the text editor. If you get the output "crontab edited" you should be fine. 
5. Check count.txt periodically to see if the program is being run. Check errors.txt to for any
errors the program prints out. Typically there will be rate-limiting exceptions thrown by Twitter
API once in awhile. Check for fatal and/or unusual errors. AdjacencyList.json should be increasing
in file length as time passes. Disable the cron job by commenting out the second line in your
crontab when you have enough users.
