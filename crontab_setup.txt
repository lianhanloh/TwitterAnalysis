type in the command " crontab -e " 
on eniac, emacs (a text editor) should open up. just type in the following two lines.
Update the file path to "pullFollowersData.sh" to the file path for that file in your eniac account

take away the "#" in front of the second line to run the cron job. you can disable it by adding the
"#" back in

Press ctrl + x, ctrl + s to save.
Press ctrl + x, ctrl + c to exit. 

if you get the output "crontab edited" you should be fine. just check count.txt to see if the count is being updated
	every minute.
